          <p>
            We fight for social and racial justice across a broad spectrum of issues ranging from rampant police brutality to affordable and decent housing. Our work fosters grassroots leadership among Black and other youth of color to build a fightback movement capable of challenging systemic inequality.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the killing of George Floyd, the simmering anger at unchecked police violence against Black and oppressed communities has boiled over. The brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations by federal, state and local governments has only strengthened the resolve of protesters to stand strong and stay in the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not just police violence that has brought this new movement into being. Widespread unemployment and sky-high rents coupled with the threat of eviction amid a pandemic are now the reality for millions of families. While banks and big business are bailed out, working people bear the brunt of the crisis
          </p>
          <p>
            The spontaneous massive uprisings that have swept the country unequivocally demonstrate the power of grassroots action. Empowering youth and building a multinational grassroots movement are the critical building blocks of our fight for social justice. It is only through organizing that we can win.

            Justice for DC recognizes that this is a fight that will take a lot to win. We believe housing is a right; no one should be denied access to shelter, certainly not in one of the richest cities in the richest country on earth. Killings by police are rare in many industrialized countries, with several reporting annual deadly encounters with police in the single digits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Change is possible, and organized action is how we'll get there.
